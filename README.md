**1. Data overview**
   
The Bird of India Dataset provides various recorded information on bird species observed in India which is not only a biological research resource, but also a strategic asset. This data is modeled from Citizen science projects like eBird which are contributed through observations and recordings by bird lovers. The main purpose of this data is to help researchers and conservationists observe the health of bird populations in India, monitor their distribution and conservation status. Beside that, this data can also help offer specialized birding trips using either uncommon species to offer an experience that is more exclusive and costly, or common species to ensure a memorable experience. Data analytics will help transform raw information into actionable decisions.
